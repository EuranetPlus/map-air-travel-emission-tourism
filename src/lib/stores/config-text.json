  "textNote": "This indicator is an estimate of the average amount of CO2 emitted per air passenger per reporting country. It is calculated by dividing the amount of CO2 emitted by all passenger flights by the number of passengers within a year. The emission quantities and the number of air passengers are associated with the airport of departing flights. Therefore, the indicator takes into account, for every airport, both residents departing for a tourist destination and tourists returning home. Lower values indicate lower emissions per air passenger. Higher country values are usually associated with long-haul flights.",
